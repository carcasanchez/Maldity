Current version: [v0.5](https://github.com/carcasanchez/Maldity/releases)

Now you can interact with objects! 

Use the command 'look' for receive a description of the current room. Combine it with 'north', 'south', 'east' and 'west' to receive descriptions of the exits. You can look items too, even if they are in your inventory or equipped.

Use 'go' and 'north', 'south', 'east' or 'west' to move between rooms. Now, you can use only 's', 'n', 'w', or 'e' if you want to move quickly.

You can use "take <item>" or "pick <item>"  to take and object from the room. Use "take <item> from <item>" if you want to take an item from other item, 
and "put <item> in <item>" to put an item into another.

Use "equip <item>" to equip an object, and "unequip" for unequip it. Some objects increase your stats. You can only have one item equiped at time, but you don't need to unequip your current one if you want to equip another: it will happens automatically. 

Use "stats" to see your status, and "inventory" or "i".

Use 'open <direction> door' if you find a closed door, or 'close <direction> door' if you want to close it.

Use 'help' to see the controls and 'quit' if you want to finish the game.


There's only two items where you can keep objects: a Coffer and a Swordcase.

You can use upper or lower letters.
